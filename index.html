<p>
    Let's take our time tonight, girl <br>
    Above us all the stars are watchin' <br>
    There's no place I'd rather be in this world <br>
    Your eyes are where I'm lost in <br>
</p>

<p>
     Underneath the chandelier <br>
    We're dancin' all alone <br>
    There's no reason to hide <br>
    What we're feelin' inside <br>
    Right now<br>
 </p>
   
 <p>
    So baby, let's just turn down the lights <br>
    And close the door<br>
    Ooh, I love that dress<br>
    But you won't need it anymore<br>
    No, you won't need it no more<br>
    Let's just kiss 'til we're naked, baby<br>
</p>

<p>
    Versace on the floor<br>
    Ooh, take it off for me<br>
    For me, for me, for me now, girl<br>
    Versace on the floor<br>
    Ooh, take it off for me<br>
    For me, for me, for me now, girl<br>
</p>

<p>
    I unzip the back to watch it fall<br>
    While I kiss your neck and shoulders<br>
    No, don't be afraid to show it off<br>
    I'll be right here ready to hold you<br>
</p>

<p>
    Girl, you know you're perfect from<br>
    Your head down to your heels<br>
    Don't be confused by my smile<br>
    'Cause I ain't ever been more for real<br>
    For real
</p>

<p>
    So just turn down the lights (down the lights)<br>
    And close the door (close the door)<br>
    Ooh, I love that dress<br>
    But you won't need it anymore<br>
    No, you won't need it no more<br>
    Let's just kiss 'til we're naked, baby<br>
</p>

<p>
    Versace on the floor<br>
    Ooh, take it off for me<br>
    For me, for me, for me now, girl<br>
    Versace on the floor<br>
    Ooh, take it off for me<br>
    For me, for me, for me now, girl<br>
    (Dance) 
</p>

<p>
    It's warmin' up<br>
    Can you feel it?<br>
    It's warmin' up<br>
    Can you feel it?<br>
    It's warmin' up<br>
    Can you feel it, baby?<br>
    It's warmin' up<br>
    Oh, seems like you're ready for more, more, more<br>
    Let's just kiss 'til we're naked<br>
</p>

<p>
    Ooh, Versace on the floor<br>
    Hey, baby<br>
    Take it off for me<br>
    For me, for me, for me now, girl<br>
    Versace on the floor<br>
    Ooh, take it off for me<br>
    For me, for me, for me now, girl<br>
</p>
